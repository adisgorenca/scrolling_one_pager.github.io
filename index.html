                      <p>MythBusters is an Australian-American science entertainment television program created by Peter Rees and produced by Australia's Beyond Television Productions. The series premiered on the Discovery Channel on January 23, 2003. The show's hosts, special effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, used elements of the scientific method to test the validity of myths, movie scenes, Internet videos, and news stories. The show was one of the most popular on Discovery Channel, being preceded only by How It's Made and Daily Planet. From 2006 to 2016, the show was overseen by British show-runner Dan Tapster, working out of Sydney, San Francisco and Manchester.</p>

                          Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman are the original MythBusters, and initially explored all the myths of the series using their combined experience with special effects. The two worked at Hyneman's effects workshop, M5 Industries; they made use of his staff, who often worked off-screen, with Hyneman and Savage usually shown doing most of the work at the shop.

                      <p>
                          As the series progressed, members of Hyneman's staff were introduced and began to appear regularly in episodes. Three such members, artist Kari Byron, builder Tory Belleci and metal-worker Scottie Chapman, were organized as a second team of MythBusters during the second season, dubbed the "Build Team". After Chapman left the show during the third season, Grant Imahara, a colleague of Hyneman, was hired to provide the team with his electrical and robotics experience.  The Build Team worked at its own workshop, called M7, investigating separate myths from the original duo. Each episode typically alternated between the two teams covering different myths. During the Build Team's tenure, Belleci was the only member to appear in every myth that the team tested.

                                  In this episode, the mythbusters determined that it is plausible for a vehicle fitted with square wheels to provide a smooth ride if driven fast enough. Mechanical failures prevented them from completing the experiment but data from sensors suggest it would work.

                                  In this episode, the mythbusters determined that you cannot completely paint a room with explosives. This was determined by detonating dynamite inside a metal sphere filled with paint.

                                  In this episode, the mythbusters determined that a video showing a "7-foot ball built from 5 million LEGO bricks bouncing off a parked car without doing any damage after rolling down a hill" is fake. When they attempted to replicate it, the LEGO ball was heavier then expected, and then fell apart after rolling down the hill.
